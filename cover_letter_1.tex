\opening{Dr. Traci Ardren,} 
 
PARAGRAPH ONE: The position of lecturer in Anthropology, advertised on the University of Miami website, is of great interest to me. I am a PhD candidate in the department of Geography at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario Canada. I currently live in Miami while I write my dissertation on medical, historical, cultural and emotional landscapes of diabetes. I am also conducting qualitative research on personal biomedical waste for The Canada Waste Flow Project. I am collaborating on a book for Ashgate titled \textit{Throw Away Societies: People, Place \& Waste}. My contribution, chapter 1, \textit{Diabetic Debris: Social Media Discourses on Personal Biomedical Waste Flows in North America} uses social media data to examine practices of disposing personal biomedical waste, to ultimately close the gap between waste policy and everyday life. 

PARAGRAPH TWO: The University of Miami has a wonderful teaching and research reputation. This position is of particular interest to me as my PhD work is in cultural and health geographies. 
I can bring critical understandings of health and medicine as well as my passionate teaching to the department. I have taught in a univeristy environment since 2011 as a teaching assistant and guest lecturer. Prior to teaching at Queen's University, I taught for four years in secondary education.  If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 
 
PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
